What I am working on

A game jam started on the Gamespot discord channel,
based around something to do with concept of gamespot,
my idea is based off the game cookie clicker using
the engine the developer for the game created to create
my own version called 10 out of 10 click being a tounge
in cheek take on games all being given 10 out of 10's.

So the aim of the game is to keep clikcling 10's while
being funny bits of information and then incorperating
the idle game mechanic becoming more common in mobile
games where you choose upgrades that will generate
clicks for you.
